# Next Steps for Astro Expansion

## Phase 2 Complete! ðŸŽ‰

All Phase 2 features have been implemented and committed:
- Digital Storage System (Storage Core, Terminal, Import/Export Buses)
- Component Assembler with advanced crafting
- Complete Drone System (5 types with AI, charging, and management)
- All GUIs, models, and recipes

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Testing
```bash
./gradlew runClient
```
Test all new features:
- Storage network formation and item storage
- Component Assembler recipes
- Drone spawning and behavior
- Import/Export bus automation
- Energy consumption balance

### 2. Create Release (Optional)
If you want to release Phase 2:
```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Phase 2: Advanced Technology"
git push origin v0.2.0

# Build release JAR
./gradlew build
# JAR will be in build/libs/
```

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin forge-1.20.1
```

## Phase 3 Planning

### Proposed Features
1. **Multiblock Structures**
   - Fusion Reactor (3x3x3)
   - Industrial Furnace Array
   - Quantum Computer

2. **Space Exploration Prep**
   - Rocket Assembly Machine
   - Fuel Refinery
   - Launch Pad multiblock

3. **Advanced Automation**
   - Programmable Controller
   - Wireless Network Cards
   - Remote Access Terminal

4. **Resource Processing**
   - Ore Quadrupling (advanced processing chain)
   - Alloy Smelter
   - Chemical Reactor

### Development Time Estimate
- Week 1: Multiblock framework and first structure
- Week 2: Space preparation machines
- Week 3: Advanced automation systems
- Week 4: Testing and balancing

## Current Mod Statistics
- **Total Blocks**: 23
- **Total Items**: 34
- **Total Entities**: 5
- **Total GUIs**: 8
- **Energy Consumers**: 10
- **Automation Tools**: 7

## Known Areas for Polish
1. Texture creation for all blocks/items (currently using placeholders)
2. Sound effects for machines and drones
3. Particle effects for active machines
4. JEI integration for all recipes
5. Config file for balance adjustments
6. Advancement/achievement tree
7. In-game documentation book

## Community Engagement
Consider:
1. Creating a mod showcase video
2. Setting up a Discord server
3. Writing a CurseForge/Modrinth description
4. Creating a wiki with crafting guides
5. Gathering feedback from early testers

The mod is in great shape with two complete phases of content!
