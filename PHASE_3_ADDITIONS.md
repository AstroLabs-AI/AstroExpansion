## Technical Implementation

### Solar Panel Logic
```java
// Time-based generation calculation
float timeModifier = getTimeModifier();
int skyLight = level.getBrightness(LightLayer.SKY, pos.above());
int generation = (int) (MAX_GENERATION * (skyLight / 15.0f) * timeModifier);
```

### Electric Furnace Integration
- Uses vanilla `SmeltingRecipe` system
- Compatible with all modded smelting recipes
- Maintains recipe compatibility

### Energy Network Expansion
All new machines properly integrate with:
- Energy Conduits for distribution
- Capability system for mod compatibility
- Visual feedback (lit state for furnace)

## Crafting Recipes (Suggested)

### Solar Panel
```
[G][G][G]
[L][E][L]
[I][R][I]

G = Glass
L = Lapis Lazuli
E = Energy Core
I = Iron Ingot
R = Redstone Block
```

### Electric Furnace
```
[I][F][I]
[C][E][C]
[I][R][I]

I = Iron Ingot
F = Furnace
C = Circuit Board
E = Energy Core
R = Redstone
```

## Balance Considerations

### Energy Generation
- **Solar Panel**: Free but inconsistent, weather/time dependent
- **Basic Generator**: Consistent but requires fuel
- Players need both for reliable power

### Energy Usage
- **Electric Furnace**: High efficiency justifies energy cost
- **Research Console**: High cost encourages infrastructure building

## Future Expansion Ideas

### Phase 3 Continuation
1. **Wind Turbine**: Height-based generation
2. **Geothermal Generator**: Lava-powered
3. **Nuclear Reactor**: High-risk, high-reward
4. **Battery Bank**: Large energy storage
5. **Wireless Energy Node**: Remote power transfer

### Phase 4 Preview
1. **Oxygen System**: Life support for space
2. **Rocket Fuel Refinery**: Process fuel for launches
3. **Launch Pad**: Multi-block rocket platform
4. **Space Suit Fabricator**: Craft protective gear
