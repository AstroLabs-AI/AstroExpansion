# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to AstroExpansion! This guide will help you get started with your journey to the stars.

## First Steps

### 1. Find Titanium Ore
- **Where:** Y-level -64 to 20
- **Tool:** Iron pickaxe or better
- **Tip:** Most common below Y=0

### 2. Craft Essential Tools
**Wrench** - Your most important tool!
- Recipe: 3 Titanium Ingots in diagonal pattern
- Use: Rotate/remove machines without losing contents

### 3. Build Your First Generator
**Basic Generator**
- Burns coal/wood for 40 FE/tick
- Internal buffer: 10,000 FE
- Powers 1-2 early machines

### 4. Set Up Ore Processing
**Material Processor**
- Turns raw ores into 2x dust
- Requires: 30 FE/tick
- Process time: 200 ticks (10 seconds)

**Ore Washer** (optional but recommended)
- Uses water for bonus output
- 10-50% chance for extra dust
- Requires: 20 FE/tick + water

### 5. Power Distribution
**Energy Conduit**
- Transfers 5,000 FE/tick
- Auto-connects to machines
- No energy loss

**Energy Storage**
- Stores 100,000 FE
- Input/Output: 1,000 FE/tick
- Retains charge when broken

## Your First Base Setup

```
[G] = Basic Generator
[M] = Material Processor
[W] = Ore Washer
[S] = Energy Storage
[=] = Energy Conduit

[G]===[S]===[M]
       |
      [W]
```

## Progression Path

### Phase 1: Basic Processing (You are here!)
✓ Mine titanium, lithium, uranium
✓ Basic ore processing
✓ Simple power generation

### Phase 2: Advanced Machines
- Component Assembler for circuits
- Industrial Furnace (3x3x2 multiblock)

### Phase 3: Digital Storage
- Storage Core + Drives
- Automated sorting

### Phase 4: Drones
- Mining and farming automation
- Combat protection

### Phase 5: Fusion Power
- Massive energy generation
- Deuterium/Tritium production

### Beyond...
- Space travel
- Moon bases
- Interdimensional exploration

## Essential Items to Craft

1. **Circuit Board** - Base for all electronics
2. **Processor** - Required for advanced machines
3. **Energy Core** - High-capacity energy storage component

## Tips for Success

- **Always use a Wrench** to move machines
- **Build Energy Storage** early - power fluctuations can halt production
- **Ore Wash everything** - the bonus output adds up
- **Read the Guide Book** - In-game documentation (craft with Book + Circuit Board + Titanium + Leather)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Breaking machines with pickaxe (loses contents)
❌ Not connecting machines with energy conduits
❌ Forgetting water supply for Ore Washer
❌ Skipping Energy Storage (power interruptions)

## Next Steps

Once you have basic ore processing running:
1. Expand power generation
2. Build Component Assembler
3. Start crafting processors
4. Plan your storage system
5. Prepare for multiblock structures
