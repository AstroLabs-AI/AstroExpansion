# Storage System Setup Guide

## Why is my Storage Terminal showing "Network Offline"?

The Storage Terminal requires a properly configured Storage Core network to function.

## Quick Setup:

1. **Place a Storage Core block**
2. **Provide Power** - Connect any FE power source (generator, energy cable, etc.)
3. **Insert a Storage Drive** - Right-click the Storage Core and insert at least one drive
4. **Place Storage Terminal** - Must be within 16 blocks of the Storage Core
5. The Storage Core will light up when the network is active!

## Requirements Checklist:

- ✅ Storage Core placed
- ✅ Power supplied to Storage Core (any amount of FE)
- ✅ At least ONE storage drive inserted (1k, 4k, 16k, or 64k)
- ✅ Storage Terminal within 16 blocks of Core

## Common Issues:

### "Network Offline" - No Power
- Solution: Connect a Basic Generator, Solar Panel, or any FE power source
- The Storage Core needs continuous power to maintain the network

### "Network Offline" - No Drives
- Solution: Craft and insert at least one storage drive
- Drives store your items - no drives means no storage!

### "Network Offline" - Too Far Away
- Solution: Move Storage Terminal closer (max 16 blocks from Core)
- The terminal scans for networks every 5 seconds

## Power Requirements:
- Base: 10 FE/tick
- Per Drive: +5 FE/tick
- Example: 1 drive = 15 FE/tick, 6 drives = 40 FE/tick

## Storage Drives:
- 1k Drive: 1,000 items
- 4k Drive: 4,000 items
- 16k Drive: 16,000 items
- 64k Drive: 64,000 items

The Storage Core has 6 drive slots for a maximum of 384,000 items!
