## 🚧 In Progress

### Storage System Polish (Week 2)
- [ ] Storage Terminal search GUI
- [ ] JEI integration for terminal
- [ ] Import/Export buses
- [ ] Wireless access terminal
- [ ] Network visualization

### Basic Drones (Week 3)
- [ ] Drone entity base class
- [ ] Mining Drone implementation
- [ ] Drone Dock block
- [ ] Basic pathfinding AI
- [ ] Energy consumption

## 📊 Current Statistics

- **New Blocks**: 2 (Storage Core, Storage Terminal)
- **New Items**: 6 (4 drives, housing, processor)
- **New GUIs**: 2 (Core management, Terminal interface)
- **New Recipes**: 6 (all craftable)
- **Lines of Code**: ~1,500 added

## 🎮 Testing Phase 2

### Creative Mode Commands
```minecraft
# Storage system components
/give @p astroexpansion:storage_core
/give @p astroexpansion:storage_terminal
/give @p astroexpansion:storage_drive_1k
/give @p astroexpansion:energy_conduit 16

# Connect to power
/give @p astroexpansion:basic_generator
/give @p minecraft:coal 64
```

### Setup Instructions
1. Place Storage Core
2. Connect to power with Energy Conduits
3. Insert Storage Drives into Core
4. Place Storage Terminal nearby (within 16 blocks)
5. Access Terminal to use storage network

## 🐛 Known Issues
- Terminal GUI needs visual implementation
- Search functionality not yet connected to GUI
- Network cable blocks not implemented (use proximity for now)

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Implement Storage Terminal search GUI
2. Add visual feedback for network connections
3. Create Import/Export bus blocks
4. Test multiplayer synchronization

### Week 3 Goals
1. Create base Drone entity class
2. Implement Mining Drone with basic AI
3. Add Drone Dock for charging
4. Create drone item/spawning system

### Week 4 Goals
1. Component Assembler machine
2. Research Console foundation
3. Connect drones to storage network
4. Balance testing

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Storage Network
- Chose proximity-based connection for simplicity
- Energy cost scales with drive count
- Terminal requires active network to open
- Drives are hot-swappable

### Technical Choices
- Used HashMap for item storage (fast lookups)
- Lazy network validation (check on access)
- Capability system for cross-mod compatibility
- Separate API package for extensions

## 🎯 Phase 2 Completion: 25%

Storage system core is complete and functional! Next focus is on polishing the GUI experience and beginning drone implementation.
