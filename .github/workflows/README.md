# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains automated workflows for the AstroExpansion project.

## Workflows

### 1. Auto Build, Push & Release (`auto-release.yml`) ðŸš€ **NEW!**
**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `forge-1.20.1` branches (auto-increments version)
- Manual workflow dispatch with version control

**Features:**
- **Automatic version bumping** (patch version on code changes)
- **Automatic changelog generation** from commits
- **Auto-push changes** back to repository
- **Auto-create GitHub releases** with built JAR
- **Manual version control** (major/minor/patch)

**Actions:**
- Detects code changes and increments version
- Builds the mod
- Generates changelog from commits
- Creates and pushes version tag
- Creates GitHub release with artifacts
- Uploads build artifacts for 30 days

### 2. Development Builds (`dev-builds.yml`) ðŸ”¨ **NEW!**
**Triggers:**
- Push to any branch except main/forge-1.20.1
- Pull requests

**Features:**
- Builds and tests on feature branches
- Comments on PRs with build status
- Uploads dev artifacts (7 day retention)

### 3. Build and Release (`build.yml`)
**Triggers:**
- Push to `forge-1.20.1` or `main` branches
- Pull requests to these branches
- Tag pushes matching `v*`

**Actions:**
- Builds the mod with Java 17
- Uploads build artifacts
- Automatically creates releases when tags are pushed
- Attaches JAR files to releases

### 2. Create Release (`release.yml`)
**Triggers:**
- Manual workflow dispatch (Actions tab â†’ Create Release â†’ Run workflow)

**Inputs:**
- `version`: Version number (e.g., 1.0.1)
- `release_notes`: Optional release notes

**Actions:**
- Updates version in gradle.properties
- Builds the mod
- Creates and pushes git tag
- Creates GitHub release with JAR attachment

## Usage

### ðŸŽ¯ Fully Automatic Releases (NEW - Recommended!)

Simply push your changes to `main` or `forge-1.20.1`:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push
```

The workflow will automatically:
1. Build the mod
2. Increment the patch version (e.g., 1.0.1 â†’ 1.0.2)
3. Generate a changelog from commits
4. Create a new release with the JAR file
5. Push the version update back to the repository

### ðŸŽ® Manual Version Control (NEW)

For major or minor version bumps:
1. Go to Actions â†’ "Auto Build, Push & Release"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select options:
   - Create release: âœ…
   - Version bump type: major/minor/patch
4. Click "Run workflow"

### Traditional Releases

1. **Create a new release via Actions:**
   ```
   Go to Actions â†’ Create Release â†’ Run workflow
   Enter version: 1.0.1
   Enter release notes: "Fixed duplicate registration bug"
   Click "Run workflow"
   ```

2. **Create a release by pushing a tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Version 1.0.1"
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

### Manual Release Process

If you prefer to create releases manually:

1. Update version in `gradle.properties`
2. Build the mod: `./gradlew clean build`
3. Create and push tag: `git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Version 1.0.1"`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.1`
5. GitHub Actions will automatically create the release

## Auto-Push Feature

The repository includes an auto-push feature that automatically pushes commits to GitHub.

### Enable Auto-Push
```bash
./autopush.sh enable
```

### Disable Auto-Push
```bash
./autopush.sh disable
```

### Check Status
```bash
./autopush.sh status
```

**Note:** Auto-push only works on `forge-1.20.1` and `main` branches.

## Secrets Required

No additional secrets are required. The workflows use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` which is automatically provided.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Check the Actions tab for detailed logs
- Ensure Java 17 compatibility
- Verify gradle wrapper is executable

### Release Creation Failures
- Ensure you have push permissions
- Check that the version tag doesn't already exist
- Verify the JAR file is being created in `build/libs/`

### Auto-Push Not Working
- Ensure the git hook is executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit`
- Check you're on an enabled branch: `forge-1.20.1` or `main`
- Verify you have push permissions to the repository
