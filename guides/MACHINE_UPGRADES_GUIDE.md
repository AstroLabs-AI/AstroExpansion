- **Tier 3**: +75% speed (1.75x multiplier)

**Best Used In**:
- Material Processor (faster ore doubling)
- Component Assembler (quicker crafting)
- Ore Washer (rapid ore cleaning)

**Trade-offs**:
- Increases energy consumption proportionally
- May cause bottlenecks in automation

### Efficiency Upgrade
**Effect**: Reduces energy consumption
- **Tier 1**: -20% energy use (0.8x multiplier)
- **Tier 2**: -35% energy use (0.65x multiplier)
- **Tier 3**: -50% energy use (0.5x multiplier)

**Best Used In**:
- Basic Generator (extends fuel duration)
- Energy-intensive machines
- Remote outposts with limited power

**Benefits**:
- Lower power infrastructure needs
- Longer runtime on batteries
- More sustainable operations

### Fortune Upgrade
**Effect**: Chance for bonus outputs
- **Tier 1**: +15% chance for extra output
- **Tier 2**: +30% chance for extra output
- **Tier 3**: +45% chance for extra output

**Best Used In**:
- Material Processor (extra ingots)
- Ore Washer (bonus materials)
- Basic Generator (bonus energy bursts)

**Mechanics**:
- Rolls per operation
- Stacks with machine bonuses
- Can trigger multiple times

## Crafting Recipes

### Tier 1 Upgrades
```
Speed Upgrade I:
[Redstone] [Processor] [Redstone]
[Titanium] [Circuit Board] [Titanium]
[Redstone] [Energy Core] [Redstone]

Efficiency Upgrade I:
[Glowstone] [Processor] [Glowstone]

```

### Tier 2 & 3 Upgrades
Combine lower tier upgrades with advanced materials:
- Tier 2: Previous tier + Advanced Processor + Titanium Plate
- Tier 3: Previous tier + Quantum Processor + Uranium Ingot

## Installation & Management

### Installing Upgrades
1. Open machine GUI
2. Locate upgrade slots (usually top or side)
3. Place upgrades in available slots
4. Effects apply immediately

### Upgrade Limits
- Most machines: 4 upgrade slots
- Multiblocks: Up to 8 slots
- Each slot accepts one upgrade
- Can mix different upgrade types

### Visual Indicators
- Installed upgrades show in GUI
- Hover for detailed stats
- Active effects display in tooltips
- Performance meters update real-time

## Machine-Specific Strategies

### Basic Generator
**Optimal Setup**: 2x Efficiency, 2x Fortune
- Maximizes fuel economy
- Provides energy bursts
- Best for early game

### Material Processor
**Optimal Setup**: 2x Speed, 1x Fortune, 1x Efficiency
- Fast ore processing
- Bonus ore outputs
- Balanced power use

### Ore Washer
**Optimal Setup**: 1x Speed, 3x Fortune
- Maximizes rare material yield
- Good for valuable ores
- Worth the extra power

### Component Assembler
**Optimal Setup**: 3x Speed, 1x Efficiency
- Rapid crafting for automation
- Reduced power drain
- Ideal for production lines

## Advanced Techniques

### Upgrade Synergies
1. **Speed + Efficiency**: Balances faster processing with power savings
2. **Fortune + Efficiency**: Maximizes output per energy unit
3. **Triple Fortune**: For maximum resource multiplication
4. **Quad Speed**: For time-critical operations

### Automation Integration
- Use comparators to detect upgrade status
- Redstone control based on upgrades
- Auto-swap upgrades with hoppers
- Priority systems for different recipes

### Power Management
Calculate power needs:
```
Base Power × Speed Multiplier × Efficiency Multiplier = Actual Usage
```

Example:
- Base: 100 FE/t
- Speed II (1.5x): 150 FE/t
- Efficiency I (0.8x): 120 FE/t final

## Upgrade Progression

### Early Game
1. Craft Efficiency I for generators
2. Add Fortune I to processors
3. Save materials for better tiers

### Mid Game
1. Upgrade to Tier 2 across machines
2. Specialize based on needs
3. Build upgrade production

### Late Game
1. Max out critical machines
