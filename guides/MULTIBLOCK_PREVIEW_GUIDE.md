# Multiblock Structure Preview Guide

Astro Expansion includes a powerful ghost block preview system that makes building complex multiblock structures easy and error-free.

## How It Works

### Activation
1. Hold the multiblock controller block
2. Right-click where you want to place it
3. Ghost blocks appear showing the complete structure
4. Sneak + right-click to hide preview

### Preview Colors
Ghost blocks use color coding to help you build:

- **ðŸŸ¦ Blue**: Empty space - place the required block here
- **ðŸŸ© Green**: Correct block already placed
- **ðŸŸ¥ Red**: Wrong block - needs to be replaced
- **â¬œ White**: Controller position (where you'll place it)

### Transparency
All ghost blocks are semi-transparent (50% opacity) so you can see through the structure and plan your build.

## Building Tips

### Preparation
1. **Clear the area**: Remove obstacles before starting
2. **Gather materials**: Check preview for exact counts
3. **Plan access**: Consider how you'll reach all positions
4. **Check orientation**: Some structures are directional

### Efficient Building
1. **Build layer by layer**: Start from bottom
2. **Follow the colors**: Place blue positions first
3. **Verify green blocks**: Ensure they're correct
4. **Fix red blocks**: Replace incorrect placements

### Common Mistakes
- **Wrong block types**: Similar-looking blocks
- **Missing corners**: Easy to overlook
- **Interior blocks**: Hidden positions
- **Orientation errors**: Directional machines

## Advanced Features

### Preview Controls
- **Show/Hide**: Sneak + right-click
- **Rotate Preview**: Not yet implemented
- **Range**: 32 blocks from controller
- **Persistence**: Stays until built or cancelled

### Integration Features
- Works with all lighting conditions
- Visible through walls (X-ray style)
- Updates in real-time as you build
- Compatible with other mods' blocks

### Performance
- Optimized rendering (no lag)
- Client-side only (no server impact)
- Automatic cleanup
- Efficient memory usage

## Troubleshooting

### Preview Not Showing?
1. Ensure holding controller block
2. Check if within range
3. Verify no obstructions
4. Try different position

### Colors Wrong?
1. Some mods' blocks may not register
2. Metadata/state differences
3. Report specific issues

### Performance Issues?
1. Reduce render distance
2. Disable other visual mods temporarily
3. Check graphics settings

## Tips for Success

### Planning
- Use preview to plan material needs
- Check clearance for large structures
- Consider automation access
- Plan power/fluid connections

### Building
- Have all materials ready
- Build systematically
- Double-check as you go
- Use preview to verify completion

### Optimization
- Place controller last
- Pre-position automation
- Plan cable/pipe routes
- Consider aesthetics

## Examples in Practice

### Scenario 1: First Multiblock
Player building their first Industrial Furnace:
1. Craft controller and 26 casings
2. Place controller preview
3. Follow blue blocks
4. Complete in minutes!

### Scenario 2: Complex Reactor
Experienced player setting up Fusion Reactor:
1. Preview shows exact coil positions
2. Build frame first
3. Place coils at corners
4. Insert core block
5. Perfect first time!

### Scenario 3: Rocket Platform
End-game rocket assembly:
1. Preview shows massive scale
2. Build pad foundation
3. Construct tower sections
4. Verify with preview
5. Ready for launch!

Remember: The preview system is your best friend for multiblock construction. Use it every time to ensure perfect builds!
