# Space Progression Guide - Streamlined Rocket System

Welcome to the new simplified space exploration system! This guide covers the complete progression from early game probes to late game cargo operations.

## üöÄ Overview

The new space system features three distinct rocket tiers, each serving a specific purpose in your space journey:

1. **Probe Rocket** (Early Game) - Unmanned exploration
2. **Personal Rocket** (Mid Game) - One-way player transport
3. **Cargo Shuttle** (Late Game) - Reusable cargo hauler

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting your space journey:
- Basic material processing setup
- Access to titanium and other advanced materials
- Energy generation (for crafting machines)
- Storage system (recommended for organizing materials)

## üéØ Tier 1: Probe Rockets (Days 20-30)

### Purpose
Send unmanned probes to space that return with valuable loot and information.

### Requirements

- No fuel needed (internal fuel)

### Crafting

**Launch Rail:**
```
[Iron Ingot] [Rail] [Iron Ingot]
[Redstone] [Iron Block] [Redstone]
[Iron Ingot] [Rail] [Iron Ingot]
```

**Probe Rocket** (craft at Rocket Workbench):
```

```

### How to Use
1. Place Launch Rail on solid ground
2. Right-click with Probe Rocket to place it
3. Right-click the rail to launch
4. Wait 60 seconds for probe to return
5. Collect dropped loot around launch site

### Possible Loot
- **Common**: Moon Dust, Iron, Gold, Redstone

- **Rare**: Alien Artifacts (30% chance)
- **Very Rare**: Space Station Keys (10% chance)

### Tips
- Launch multiple probes for better loot chances
- Clear area around launch rail for loot collection
- Save Alien Artifacts for late game crafting

## üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Tier 2: Personal Rockets (Days 40-50)

### Purpose
One-way transport to space dimension for player exploration.

### Requirements
- **Launch Rail** (same as probe)
- **Personal Rocket** (consumable)
- **Water Bucket** (fuel)
- **Full Space Suit** (protection)

### Crafting

**Personal Rocket** (at Rocket Workbench):
```
[Titanium Plate] [Glass] [Titanium Plate]
[Titanium Plate] [Water Bucket] [Titanium Plate]
[Iron Block] [Processor] [Iron Block]
```

**Space Suit** (if you don't have one):
- Space Helmet: Glass + Titanium + Oxygen Mask
- Space Chestplate: Titanium Plates + Life Support
- Space Leggings: Titanium Plates + Thermal Padding
- Space Boots: Titanium Plates + Rubber

### How to Use
1. Equip full Space Suit
2. Place Personal Rocket on Launch Rail
3. Right-click rocket with Water Bucket to fuel
4. Right-click to board the rocket
5. Hold SPACE key to launch!
6. Teleports to Space dimension at 300+ altitude

### Space Dimension Features
- Zero gravity movement
- Abandoned space stations (rare)
- No natural resources (bring supplies!)
- Return via Space Teleporter

### Safety Tips
- **ALWAYS** wear full space suit
- Bring building materials for safety platform
- Pack food and tools
- Consider bringing Space Teleporter for return

## üöö Tier 3: Cargo Shuttles (Days 60+)

### Purpose
Reusable spacecraft for transporting large amounts of cargo between dimensions.

### Requirements
- **3x3 Landing Pad** (9 blocks total)
- **Cargo Shuttle** (reusable)
- **Deuterium Cells** (fuel)
- Optional: Auto-pilot programming

### Crafting

**Landing Pad** (9 needed):
```
[Concrete] [Iron Ingot] [Concrete]
[Iron Ingot] [Iron Block] [Iron Ingot]
[Concrete] [Iron Ingot] [Concrete]
```

**Cargo Shuttle** (at Rocket Workbench):
```
[Titanium Block] [Adv. Processor] [Titanium Block]
[Titanium Block] [Energy Core] [Titanium Block]
[Plasma Injector] [Chest] [Plasma Injector]
```

### How to Use
1. Build 3x3 Landing Pad platform
2. Right-click center with Cargo Shuttle
3. Fuel with Deuterium Cells (right-click with cells)
4. Access cargo inventory (right-click empty-handed)
5. Mount shuttle (right-click without shifting)
6. Launch when ready!

### Features
- **54-slot inventory** for massive cargo
- **Reusable** - doesn't consume the item
- **Auto-pilot** - Shift+right-click to toggle
- **2000 fuel capacity** - Multiple trips per tank

### Fuel Management
- Each Deuterium Cell adds 500 fuel
- Launch costs ~100 fuel
- Full trip to space and back ~300 fuel
- Craft Deuterium in Fuel Refinery

## üåå Space Exploration

### Abandoned Space Stations
Generated rarely in Space dimension, containing:
- Advanced technology loot
- Alien Artifacts
- Research Data
- Quantum/Advanced Processors
- Rare materials

### Finding Stations
1. Use Probe Rockets to get coordinates (rare drop)
2. Explore Space dimension systematically
3. Look for station lights in the void
4. Space Station Keys unlock special rooms

### Station Loot Table
- **Common**: Titanium, Energy Cores, Processors
- **Uncommon**: Plasma Injectors, Research Data
- **Rare**: Quantum Processors, Alien Artifacts
- **Unique**: Space Station Keys, Ancient Technology

## üìä Progression Summary

| Tier | Rocket Type | Days | Purpose | Fuel | Reusable |
|------|------------|------|---------|------|----------|
| 1 | Probe | 20-30 | Loot gathering | None | No |
| 2 | Personal | 40-50 | Player transport | Water | No |
| 3 | Cargo | 60+ | Cargo hauling | Deuterium | Yes |

## üéØ Goals by Phase

### Early Space (Days 20-40)
- Launch 10+ probe rockets
- Collect Alien Artifacts
- Stockpile space materials
- Build Rocket Workbench

### Mid Space (Days 40-60)
- First manned space flight
- Explore space dimension
- Locate space station
- Establish space base

### Late Space (Days 60+)
- Build cargo infrastructure
- Regular cargo runs
- Full station exploration
- Automate space logistics

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Probe Spam**: Launch many probes early for resources
2. **Fuel Economy**: Water is cheap, use it liberally
3. **Station Maps**: Mark station coordinates when found
4. **Cargo Routes**: Establish regular shuttle schedules
5. **Emergency Return**: Always carry Space Teleporter

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Rocket won't launch:**
- Check fuel (water/deuterium)
- Verify launch infrastructure
- Ensure space suit equipped (personal rocket)

**Can't find stations:**
- They're rare (10% per valid chunk)
- Use probe coordinates
- Explore systematically

**Lost in space:**
- Build platform at spawn
- Use Space Teleporter
- Cargo shuttle with auto-pilot

## üéâ Conclusion

The streamlined rocket system makes space accessible to all players! Start with simple probes, progress to personal flights, and eventually run cargo operations. No more complex multiblocks - just build, fuel, and fly!

Happy exploring, Space Pioneer! üöÄ
