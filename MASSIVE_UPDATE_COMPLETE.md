### 6. ✅ New Machines

#### Recycler
- Breaks down items into scrap or base materials
- 15% chance for scrap, 10% for material recovery
- Smart material detection (tools → nuggets, blocks → ingots)
- Upgradeable with standard upgrade system
- Animated recycling effect in GUI

#### Matter Fabricator
- Creates UU-Matter from energy (1M FE per mB)
- Scrap amplification (25% energy reduction)
- 10,000 mB internal tank
- Quantum particle effects
- End-game power requirements

#### Matter Duplicator
- Uses UU-Matter to duplicate items
- Variable costs based on item rarity
- Template-based duplication
- Integrated with Matter Fabricator

#### Advanced Teleporter
- Point-to-point teleportation within dimensions
- Frequency-based linking system
- 3x3x3 multiblock structure
- Energy cost based on distance
- Network support for multiple destinations
- Portal animation and particle effects

### 7. ✅ Quality of Life Improvements
- **Machine Enhancements**:
  - All machines show detailed tooltips
  - Energy costs and generation rates visible
  - Progress indicators with time remaining
  - Upgrade effects clearly displayed
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Active/inactive states clearly shown
  - Particle effects indicate processing
  - GUI animations show machine activity

## Technical Implementation Details

### Base Classes Created
- `UpgradeItem`: Base for all upgrade items
- `UpgradeableMachineBlockEntity`: Base for upgradeable machines
- `AnimatedWidget`: Base for GUI animations
- `MachineTier`: Enum for machine tiers
- `MachineParticles`: Utility for particle effects

### New Items Added
- 9 Upgrade Items (3 types × 3 tiers)
- Scrap (recycling byproduct)
- UU-Matter Bucket
- Teleporter Frequency Card
- Quantum Core (crafting component)
- Various supporting items

### New Blocks Added
- Recycler
- Matter Fabricator
- Matter Duplicator
- Advanced Teleporter
- Teleporter Frame
- 9 Tiered machine variants

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Complete JEI Integration (requires JEI API setup)
2. Multiblock formation animations
3. Structure preview with ghost blocks
4. Portable storage tablet
5. Wireless storage access

### Medium Priority
1. Batch processing modes
2. Secondary output preview
3. Pattern storage for assembler
4. Chunk loading for machines
5. Config GUI system

### Low Priority
1. More particle effect variations
2. Sound effect improvements
3. Achievement expansions
4. Integration with other mods

## Performance Considerations
- Particle effects use randomness to reduce spawn rate
- GUI animations use efficient rendering
- Upgrade calculations are cached
- Network packets are optimized

## Balance Notes
- Tiered machines require progressively expensive materials
- Matter Fabricator needs fusion-level power
- Teleporter energy scales with distance
- Upgrades have diminishing returns when stacked

This massive update significantly enhances AstroExpansion's gameplay experience with visual polish, quality of life improvements, and new end-game content while maintaining performance and balance.
