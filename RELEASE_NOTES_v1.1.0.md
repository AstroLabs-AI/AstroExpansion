This release marks a significant milestone with a complete overhaul of the texture system, implementing professional pixel art standards across all 110+ textures in the mod.

## üìù Changelog

### Added
- **Professional Texture Generator**: New advanced texture generation system with:
  - Floyd-Steinberg dithering for smooth color transitions
  - Material-based rendering (metal, crystal, energy, organic)
  - Limited color palettes (4-8 colors) for authentic pixel art
  - Selective edge highlighting for 3D depth perception
  - Proper shading and lighting techniques
- **Auto-versioning System**: New versioning scripts for consistent releases
- **Face-specific Textures**: All machine blocks now have proper _top, _side, and _front textures

### Changed
- **Complete Texture Replacement**: All 110+ textures regenerated from scratch
  - Machines: All tiers (basic, advanced, elite) with tier-specific visual progression
  - Ores: Realistic mineral patterns with proper stone integration
  - Items: Consistent style with material-appropriate rendering
  - GUI: Clean, professional interfaces with proper slot highlights
- **Consistent Visual Language**: 
  - Metallic items use proper specular highlights
  - Energy items have animated glow effects
  - Crystal items feature transparency and refraction
  - Organic items use natural color palettes

### Fixed
- Invisible items caused by missing textures (scrap, artifacts, fragments, etc.)
- Machine blocks not displaying due to missing face textures
