# Phase 2 Completion Summary

## Implemented Features

### New Blocks and Machines
1. **Battery Bank** - Large energy storage (1M RF)
2. **Force Field Generator** - Creates protective force fields with configurable shapes
3. **Oxygen Generator** - Converts water to oxygen for life support
4. **Teleporter** - Instant transportation between linked teleporters
5. **Wireless Energy Node** - Wireless power transmission up to 32 blocks
6. **Rocket** - Space vehicle for interplanetary travel (placeholder implementation)

### New Items
1. **Space Suit Armor** - Full set (Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots)
   - Provides oxygen storage and consumption
   - Environmental protection effects
   - Titanium-based construction

### GUI Screens
All new machines have fully implemented GUI screens:
- ForceFieldGeneratorScreen - Controls shape, radius, and activation
- OxygenGeneratorScreen - Shows oxygen production and storage
- RocketScreen - Launch controls and fuel gauge
- TeleporterScreen - Coordinate input and link management
- WirelessEnergyNodeScreen - Shows connections and energy flow

### Crafting Recipes
Added recipes for all new blocks and items:
- Battery Bank: Titanium + Energy Cores + Circuit Board
- Force Field Generator: Diamond Blocks + Advanced Processors + Battery Bank
- Oxygen Generator: Iron + Glass + Sugar Cane + Processor
- Teleporter: Ender Pearls + Diamond Blocks + Uranium + Battery Bank
- Wireless Energy Node: Titanium + Redstone Blocks + Energy Core
- Space Suit: Titanium-based armor with special components

### Block Entities
All machines properly extend AbstractMachineBlockEntity with:
- Energy storage and management
- Process tracking
- NBT serialization
- Container menus
- Client-server synchronization

## Technical Implementation
- Fixed constructor issues in all BlockEntities
- Added required menu methods for GUI functionality
- Integrated with existing registry system
- Added language entries for all new content

## What's Missing
1. Textures for all new blocks and items (placeholder purple-black)
2. Actual rocket launch functionality (needs dimension system)
3. Force field collision/protection logic
4. Wireless energy network visualization
5. Oxygen distribution system

## Next Steps
1. Create texture assets (16x16 PNGs)
2. Implement Phase 3 features (Dimensions, Advanced Tech)
3. Add JEI integration for recipes
4. Balance energy consumption and production rates
5. Add sound effects and particles
